= Covers

== Front and back covers

You can specify an image or a PDF page to use as either cover of the document directly in your theme.
The front cover image is assigned using the `front-image` key, and the back cover image using the `back-image` key.
Both keys are set on the xref:cover.adoc[cover category].

These keys accept the following values:

* a nil value (i.e., `~`)
* an empty string (i.e., `''`)
* the string literal `'~'` (front cover only)
* a bare absolute or relative path
* an absolute path, relative path, or data URI as the target of an inline image macro

A nil value turns off the cover page for that face.
An empty string indicates that you want to insert a blank page.
The string literal `'~'` (not `~`) indicates you want the converter to behave as though a front cover is present, but no page is added.
This hint is only relevant for the front cover of a prepress book (i.e., doctype=book and media=prepress).

An absolute path is always used as is.
A relative path is resolved from the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute, which defaults to the directory of the theme file.

TIP: See xref:images.adoc#specify[Specify a background image in the theme] for learn how to configure a path that's not relative to the value of `pdf-themesdir`.

Specifying the path as the target of an inline image macro allows you to specify parameters for that image, as shown here:

[,yaml]
----
cover:
  front:
    image: image:cover.pdf[page=2]
  back:
    image: image:splash.png[fit=fill]
----

A cover image is handled like a xref:images.adoc#background[background image], so the xref:images.adoc#attributes[fit, width, and position attributes] can be specified.

If the path points to a PDF file, the first page of the file is used unless another page is specified by the `page` attribute.
That PDF page will be imported as is.
