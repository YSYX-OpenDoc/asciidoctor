= Extends Category Key
:description: Reference list of the extends category key and its value types.
:navtitle: Extends
:source-language: yaml

A theme can extend another theme using the `extends` key.

The `extends` key should always be the first key in the theme file.
The key accepts either a single value or an array of values.
Each value is interpreted as a filename with an implicit `-theme.yml` suffix if not already present.

If the value is `default`, it resolves to the filename of the default (built-in) theme.
If the value is an absolute path, it's used as is.
If the value begins with `./`, it's always resolved to a theme file relative to the current theme file.
Otherwise, the filename is resolved relative to the value of the `pdf-themesdir` attribute.

Currently, the theme starts out empty.
Then, the files referenced by the extends key are loaded in order.
Each time a theme is loaded, the flattened keys are overlaid onto the keys from the previous theme.
Finally, the keys in the current file are loaded.
